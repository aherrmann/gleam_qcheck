# qcheck

QuickCheck-inspired property-based testing with integrated shrinking for [Gleam](https://gleam.run/).

Rather than specifying test cases manually, you describe the invariants that values of a given type must satisfy ("properties").  Then, generators generate lots of values (test cases) on which the properties are checked.  Finally, if a value is found for which a given property does not hold, that value is "shrunk" in order to find an nice, informative counter-example that is presented to you.

While there are a ton of great articles introducing quickcheck or property-based testing, here are a couple general resources that you may enjoy:

- [An introduction to property based testing](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/pbt/)
- [What is Property Based Testing?](https://hypothesis.works/articles/what-is-property-based-testing/)

## Usage

The main modules that you will be interacting with are `qcheck/qtest` and `qcheck/generator`.

- `qcheck/qtest` contains the functions used to actually run the property tests.
  - `qcheck/qtest/config` contains functions and types for setting the configuration options for the property tests.
- `qcheck/generator` contains the functions used to generate the values that drive the property tests, as well as additional tools for creating your own generators.

### Example

Here is a short example to get you started.  It assumes you are using [gleeunit](https://github.com/lpil/gleeunit) to run the tests, but any test runner will do.


```gleam
import gleeunit/should
import qcheck/generator
import qcheck/qtest
import qcheck/qtest/config as qtest_config

pub fn small_positive_or_zero_int__test() {
  qtest.run(
    config: qtest_config.default(),
    generator: generator.small_positive_or_zero_int(),
    property: fn(n) { n + 1 == 1 + n },
  )
  |> should.equal(Ok(Nil))
}

pub fn small_positive_or_zero_int__failures_shrink_to_zero__test() {
  qtest.run(
    config: qtest_config.default(),
    generator: generator.small_positive_or_zero_int(),
    property: fn(n) { n + 1 != 1 + n },
  )
  |> should.equal(Error(0))
}
```

- `qtest.run` sets up the test
  - `qtest.run` return values:
    - If a property holds for all generated values, then `qtest.run` returns `Ok(Nil)`.
    - If a property does not hold for all generated values, then `qtest.run` returns `Error(value)`, where `value` is a potentially shrunk value of the same type as generated by the given generator.
- `qtest_config.default()` is provides the default configuration
- `generator.small_positive_or_zero_int()` generates small integers greather than or equal to zero
- `fn(n) { n + 1 == 1 + n }` is the property being tested in the first test.
  - It should be true for all generated values.
  - The return value of `qtest.run` will be `Ok(Nil)`, because the property does hold for all generated values.
- `fn(n) { n + 1 != 1 + n }` is the property being tested in the second test. 
  - It should be false for all generated values.
  - The return value of `qtest.run` will be `Error(0)`, because the property does not hold for all generated values, and the smallest value for which the property does not hold is 0.

#### More examples

The [test](https://github.com/mooreryan/gleam_qcheck/tree/main/test) directory of this repository has many examples of setting up tests, using the built-in generators, and creating new generators.  Until more dedicated documentation is written, the tests can provide some good info, as they exercise most of the available behavior of the `qtest` and `generator` modules.

### Integrating with testing frameworks

You don't have to do anything special to integrate `qcheck` with a testing framework like [gleeunit](https://github.com/lpil/gleeunit).  The only thing required is that your testing framework of choice be able to check the return values of `qtest.run` (or `qtest.run_result`).

## Roadmap

While `qcheck` has a lot of features needed to get started with property-based testing, there are still things that could be added or improved.

### Generators 

- More convenience functions for 
  - `Dict` generators
  - `Float` generators
  - `List` generators
  - `Set` generators
- Some generators could use better "tuning".
  - Ensure common generators hit the corner cases with a high enough frequency.
  - Consider more or alternative generators from:
    - [random-generator](https://github.com/gasche/random-generator) 
    - [base_quickcheck](https://github.com/janestreet/base_quickcheck)
- Speed up the `String` generators.  (These are currently quite slow!)
- "Char" generators
  - Figure out better defaults for the "char" generators.  Right now they are focused on ascii characters mainly.
  - Having "char" generators is a little weird in a language without a `Char` type, but they are currently needed for generating and shrinking strings.
  - Some of the char generators take integers representing codepoints, but this is kind of awkward to work with.
- State-machine testing as in [qcstm](https://github.com/jmid/qcstm)
- Handle recursive data types.  See:
  - [QCheck2.Gen.Fix](https://ocaml.org/p/qcheck-core/latest/doc/QCheck2/Gen/index.html#recursive-data-structures)
  - [Generating Recursive Values](https://ocaml.org/p/base_quickcheck/latest/doc/Base_quickcheck/Generator/index.html#generating-recursive-values)
- Observers. See:
  - [Observer](https://ocaml.org/p/base_quickcheck/latest/doc/Base_quickcheck/Observer/index.html)
  - [Observable](https://ocaml.org/p/qcheck-core/latest/doc/QCheck2/Observable/index.html)
  - The section on Observers from [here](https://blog.janestreet.com/quickcheck-for-core/)
- Generators for `bit_array`?

### Other stuff

- There are some places that use `let assert` to check for errors, especially checking for bad arguments.  These should be addressed.
  - Also, when appropriate, function arguments should be validated and good errors should be returned.
- Tests counts in `qtest/config` that are too high can cause timeouts.
- Include more info (other than just the shrunk value) in counter-examples.
- Don't leak the `prng` types.
